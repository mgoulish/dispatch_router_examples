This example assumes you have already done example 01_hello_world
from this directory, so you already have Dispatch Router installed 
on your system.


1. run ./start_routers


2. run ./start_clients 


3. You should probably kill all the routers afterward,
   so there won't be a conflict if you run this again later.
